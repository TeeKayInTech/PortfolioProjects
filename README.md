# PortfolioProjects

Hello World! (kidding) 

My name is Tiyana Kelly AKA Teekay and this is my project portfolio repo! I'm currently a cell and gene therapy production scientist transitioning into the world of tech and data science. Why? - I hear you and my mother ask? Well, because I made the decision to upskill myself and move into a career that not only allows me to have more ownership over my work, but also allows me to be creative!

I love the method of taking something confusing and complex like data, and translating it to media thats easy for everyone to understand. Telling a story with data is somehing i strive to do. 

As of January 2022 i started to take action on what career i want. I have now created a portfolio and continue to create projects using Python, Pycharm IDE, Jupyter notebooks, SQL, PostgreSQL, Excel, and Tableau.
